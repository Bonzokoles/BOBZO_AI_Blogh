## Type Hints Weirdness

🤷 For some inexpicable reason, type hints only work if you ctrl+space (or equivalent) on the closing tag of a component.

## Demo & Astro Info

**Alkaline** is a sleek, Astro-powered theme designed for speed, clarity, and low-JavaScript sites.
It ships with **14 built-in color themes**, **multiple layouts**, **24 pre-built components**, and **SEO optimizations**—all while keeping dependencies minimal.

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMagicianNamedGob/alkaline
cd alkaline
pnpm install // or npm install
pnpm dev // or npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4321` in your browser.

## 🛠️ Configurations

- **alkaline.config.ts** – Main theme configuration. Customize site metadata, authors, fonts, and other global settings. Feeds data across the site and can be tailored to your needs.

- **google-fonts.ts** – Preloaded with 250 Google Fonts. Add more by simply including the font name in the type.

- **Types/types.ts** – TypeScript definitions for Alkaline. Ensures type safety and consistency across the project. Works with `alkaline.config.ts` for a smooth configuration experience.

### Preconfigured files (usually no changes needed unless customizing)

- `astro.config.mjs`
- `content.config.ts` *(advanced options available)*
- `eslint.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `tsconfig.json`

## 👻 Dependencies Docs

While Alkaline is designed to be lightweight with minimal dependencies, it does rely on a few key packages to deliver its features and performance. Here are the main dependencies used in Alkaline, as well as links to their documentation for further reference:

- Astro - <https://astro.build/docs>
- TailwindCSS - <https://tailwindcss.com/docs>
- Astro-Icon - <https://:github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon>
- MDX - <https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started>

## 🔮 Roadmap

Alkaline is stable as-is, but the **future focus is a Next.js rebuild**.
That means this repo is a foundation and reference point, not a long-term home for contributions.

Planned steps:

- [x] Live demo site
- [x] Accessibility refinements
- [ ] Potential upgrade to TailwindCSS v4
- [ ] Next.js rebuild (Alkaline v2)

## 🤝 Contributing

Right now, **pull requests aren’t being accepted**, since the Next.js rebuild will change the project’s direction, but that may change based on interest and demand.

That said, **discussions and feedback are welcome**—feel free to open an [issue](../../issues) if you have ideas, requests, or spot a bug.
